Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1

Output: 3

Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
