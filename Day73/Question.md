Path Sum

Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return true if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals targetSum.

A leaf is a node with no children.

 

Example 1:

Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1], targetSum = 22

Output: true

Explanation: The root-to-leaf path with the target sum is shown.
