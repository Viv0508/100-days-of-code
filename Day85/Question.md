Validate Binary Search Tree


Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:

The left 
subtree
 of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
 

Example 1:

Input: root = [2,1,3]

Output: true
